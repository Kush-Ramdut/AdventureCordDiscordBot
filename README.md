🐉 CURRENT RPG BOT FEATURES AS OF 04/21/25🧙 :

- CREATE A CHARACTER⚔️ : Players can create an adventurer to play as by typing "$create {name} {class}". The current classes to choose from are warrior, mage, tank, and peasant. You must type the class in lowercase. EX: "$create Kash warrior". Players are currently only allowed 1 player, so attempting to create a second character will not work at the moment.

- SEE THE FULL LIST OF ADVENTURERS🧙‍♂️ : Players can view the full list of adventurers by typing "$list"

- DELETE YOUR CHARACTER❌ : If you wanna choose a new name or class don't fear! I've implemented a delete feature you can access by typing "$delete". The bot will then ask you if you wish to delete your character in which you can either respond "yes" or "no". You can only use one of those two words to answer that question and you MUST TYPE IT IN LOWERCASE

MORE TO COME SOON💪 💪
